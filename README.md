# UBCPionML
Scripts for personal contributions/modifications to the ATLAS ML pion projects

### Most of this code was re-writing the classifier into Python scripts
### Second goal was to run this code for annealing and optimize the classifier
In addition, some set-up for running code on the Cedar computer has been included here for large scale optimization projects
